Data Structure:
We use a struct named Student to store the student's name, ID, and grades.
A map (students) is used to store Student objects, with the student ID as the key for easy lookup.

Features Implemented:
Add Student: Allows users to add a new student by providing a name and ID.
Add Grade: Allows users to add grades to an existing student.
Display Grades: Displays the grades of all students.
Calculate Average: Calculates and displays the average grade for each student.
Save and Load: Saves all student data to a file (student_data.txt) and loads it on program start.
